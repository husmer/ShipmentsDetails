# Shipments CRUD page:

## This is an HTML Page with relevant Javascript to:
- Load shipments data with AJAX from https://my.api.mockaroo.com/shipments.json?key=5e0b62d0 or use local shipments.json file when the API is down.
- Display data in generated table.
- Delete button to delete data rows from the table (Backend currently not implemented. When the page reloads original data is again visualized.)
- Open a panel to visualize details of a single row.
- Change data fields in the Shipment Details panel (Changes revert back to original data when the page is reloaded :( backend not implemented.)
